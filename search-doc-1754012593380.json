History Range‚Äã  You can include all past conversation history in the prompt using history messages. However, this would consume too many tokens, leading to increased costs. Alternatively, depending on the agent's purpose, you may only need specific messages rather than the entire conversation.  Through History Range, you can specify a range starting from either the oldest or newest messages to include in the prompt. This helps manage token usage and focus on relevant conversation context. For example, let's say the session's history is in the following state:  [1] User: Hello! How are you today? [2] AI: I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you? [3] User: I'm looking for a good book recommendation. [4] AI: What genre are you interested in? Fiction, non-fiction, mystery? [5] User: I love science fiction novels.
